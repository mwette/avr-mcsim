The scheduler is bla

Time scheduler (tmsch):
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Time is represented in fixed point.
\item
  Events are scheduled at a specific time plus/minus N*$\epsilon$
  (or neps) where $-100 < neps < 100$ and $neps != 0$.
\item
  When we advance time to $t$, all events at $t + neps$ for $neps < 0$
  are executed.  When we start again, events for $t + neps$ for $neps
  > 0$ will be executed.
\item
  neps = -1,99 should be reserved for telemetry collection
\item
  Todo on telemetry:  If collected at -1 and not changed by 99 can we
  skip collection?  Think about this.
\end{itemize}

Tick scheduler (tkosc + tkclk):
\begin{itemize}
\item We use neps but all events are executed.  We would not expect to
  use $neps < 0$.
\end{itemize}
